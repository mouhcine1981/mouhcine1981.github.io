## How has the New Hanover County changed over the last decade?
# A non-pandemic related post
The pandemic has, rightfully, consumed most policy makers' attention as economies around the world were disrupted. It is, however, important to examine how the local economy was changing even before this
most recent shock. To that end, this post will focus on how the New Hanover county has changed over the last by examining changes in the labor market, commuting behavior, and xxx.
For the purposes of this analysis, we will rely on the 1-year estimates from  **American Community Survey** . The U.S. Census Bureau publishes American
Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates for geographic areas with populations of 65,000 or more.
The 65,000-population threshold ensures that 1-year
data are available for all regions, divisions, states,
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, congressional districts, Public Use Microdata Areas, and many
large counties and county equivalents, metropolitan
and micropolitan areas, cities, school districts, and
American Indian areas.
