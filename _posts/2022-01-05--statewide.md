## How are the U.S. states doing?
The pandemic has wreaked havoc on U.S. and international labor markets. The labor force participation rate is still significantly below its pre-pandemic level, there are stories about the great resignation, and concerns about labor shortages continue to plague businesses. In Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 we show the percentage change in a few different measures of the labor market's health across states between November 2019 and November 2021. Specifically, we highlight the state of  employment, labor force participation rate, unemployment rate, and employment to population ratio. In Figure 1, we show that as of November 2021, there are eleven states - Utah (3.5%), Arizona (2.1%), Idaho (2.1%), Oregon (1.7%), South Dakota (1.49%), Montana (1.05%), Oklahoma (0.94%), Wisconsin (0.7%), Florida (0.4%), Georgia (0.2%), and South Carolina (0.2%) - that have more jobs in November 2021 than in November 2019. The other 39 states -including North Carolina (-1.7%)- have yet to recover all the jobs lost during the pandemic with Connecticut (-7.8%) and Hawaii (7.7%) being the hardest hit.

## Figure 2: Labor force participation rate
The labor force participation rate is as of November 2021 still below November 2019 levels in every state except Oregon.

## Figure 3: Emmployment to population ratio
We turn towards an alternative definition of labor market health by showing the employment to population ratio. This measure is at times preferred to the Labor force participation rate because it is not contingent on search behavior by the unemployed individual. Using this measure, 47 states have an employment to population ratio is down as of November 2021 relative to the same month in 2019.

## Figure 4: Unemployment rate
Lastly, we show the percentage change in the unemployment rate across states. Similar to the other measures, it is clear that there are still a number of states that are struggling. There are 38 states that have an unemployment rate higher than the November 2019 level. Hawaii's unemployment rate as of November 2021 is 185\% higher than it was in November 2019.
