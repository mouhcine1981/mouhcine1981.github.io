## How has the New Hanover County changed over the last decade?
# A non-pandemic related post
The pandemic has, rightfully, consumed most policy makers' attention as economies around the world were disrupted. It is, however, important to examine how the local economy was changing even before this
most recent shock. To that end, this post will focus on how the New Hanover county has changed over the last decade by examining changes in the labor market, commuting behavior, and xxx.
For the purposes of this analysis, we will rely on the 1-year estimates from  **American Community Survey** . The U.S. Census Bureau publishes American
Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates for geographic areas with populations of 65,000 or more. The 65,000-population threshold ensures that 1-year
data are available for all regions, divisions, states,
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, congressional districts, Public Use Microdata Areas, and many
large counties and county equivalents, metropolitan
and micropolitan areas, cities, school districts, and
American Indian areas. It is important to note the measures derived from the survey come with
a margin of error. This margin of error (MOE) is a measure of the possible variation of the estimate around the population value. We will present both the estimates as well as these margins
of error when discussing the changes in the New Hanover economy.
# What exactly has changed?
Since 2010, New hanover county has considerably more people, more employed individuals, a higher median income, and a significantly higher share of indviduals working from home.
- In 2010, the population over the age of 16 was 166,752. In 2019, that number has increased by 30,135 or 18.07%. By way of comparison, the statewide population increased by 12.36% during the same span.
- The number of people employed has increased by 21,808 or 22.5%.
- The median household income -which is presented in inflation adjusted dollars- has increased by more than 10,000 dollars.
- Perhaps most strikingly, the share of people working from home has increased from 4% in 2010 to almost 11% in 2019 which is a 6.9 percentage point increase. This change, however, does not appear to be unique to Wilmington as
many other counties seem to have experienced increase. New Hanover county's increase is the most pronounced in the state. Of note is that these adjustments are from 2019 which precedes the significant work from home shift caused by the
pandemic.
- We also show in Figure 4 the average commuting times have remained around 20 minutes in the county even if they are measured with considerable error. which seem to have remained rather stable.

## Figure 4: Share working from home
The significant increase in the share of residents working from home is an indication of a changing economy. The industrial structure of the county has evolved with Professional and Business
services playing a larger role which may be a contributing factor in this shift. These sectoral shifts coupled with amenity driven migration and the decentralization of many industries
were likely accelerated even futher due to the pandemic. It would not be surprising to see a considerable increase in the share working from post-pandemic as some of the temporary
adjustments become permanent.

## Is this a New Hanover county change only?

large as New Hanover county. The county with the second highest increase was Moore county where the share of people working from home increase by 6.1 percentage points.
