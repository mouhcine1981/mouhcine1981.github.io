## How much do U.S. consumers spend on gasoline?
Oil prices and as a result gasoline prices, have risen considerably since the start of the Ukranian war. Concerns about prices at the pump add to the high inflation the country has been experiencing due to the supply shortages and the consequences of the pandemic. In this short piece, I provide some basic statistics on how much the average American spends on gasoline, how that differs by income group, 
and how these increases will translate in additional costs.

The average share of pre-tax income spent on gasoline was just below 2% in 2020. The share of income people spend on gasoline declined substantially between 2014 and 2020 due to the downward pressure on oil prices experienced since 2014 when that share was as high as 3.7%.


The recent increases in oil prices have significant ramifications for gas prices and the cost of many things that we consume on a daily basis. Below is a limited, but I think important, picture of the bite that higher gas prices take out of a person's budget 
## Figure 1: Share of pre-tax income spent on gasoline

These increases in gas prices affect all households but, in particular, those with lower incomes as the share of income spent on gasoline decreases in income. Figure 2 shows
that the lowest 10% -in terms of income- spent more than 11% of pre-tax income on gasoline while the highest 10% spent only 0.78%. It is, unsurprising, that higher income individuals
spend a smaller of share of their income on gasoline but the differences in burden across deciles make it clear that the most recent gas price increases will, undoubtedly, fall heavily on those with lower incomes.

The highest decile spend more in absolute terms but, of course, those amounts are a much smaller share of their income. 
The average consumer in 2020 spent almost 1,600 dollars a year on gasoline.

In an attempt to understand the implications of the higher prices on each of the decile, we show below the additional dollars that households would need to allocate to gasoline if a 40% increase were to stay in place for a full year.
This is clearly a very narrow assessment of how higher gas prices affect people because everything from the cost of bread to the cost of an airplane ticket is influenced but it is a starting point to understanding the implications.
